# Welcome to my React 25 + 5 Clock project

## This is part of the frontend project for my certificate on [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

this is a simple project you only need to clone the project
cd the folder
after that npm install
and then npm run dev and you should see the project running

This was a really intersting project, and fun to do, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
